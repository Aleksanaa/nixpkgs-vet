- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `pkgs.nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  This is however not the case: The first `callPackage` argument is the wrong path.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:2:3 as

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./someDrv.nix { /* ... */ };
This PR introduces the above problems, merging would break the base branch
