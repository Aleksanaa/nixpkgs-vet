- Because pkgs/by-name/a/a exists, the attribute `pkgs.a` must be defined like

    a = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/a/a/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  Notably the second argument must not be empty, which is not the case.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:2 as

    a = self.callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/a/a/package.nix { };

- Attribute `pkgs.b` is a new top-level package using `pkgs.callPackage ... { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/b/b/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` in /home/tweagysil/src/nixpkgs/by-name-improv/pkgs/test/nixpkgs-check-by-name/tests/sorted-order/all-packages.nix is needed anymore.

- Because pkgs/by-name/c/c exists, the attribute `pkgs.c` must be defined like

    c = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/c/c/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  Notably the second argument must not be empty, which is not the case.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:4 as

    c = self.callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/c/c/package.nix { };

- Attribute `pkgs.d` is a new top-level package using `pkgs.callPackage ... { /* ... */ }`.
  Please define it in pkgs/by-name/d/d/package.nix instead.
  See `pkgs/by-name/README.md` for more details.
  Since the second `callPackage` argument is `{ }`, no manual `callPackage` in /home/tweagysil/src/nixpkgs/by-name-improv/pkgs/test/nixpkgs-check-by-name/tests/sorted-order/all-packages.nix is needed anymore.

This PR introduces the above problems compared to the base branch, merging is discouraged, but would not break the base branch
