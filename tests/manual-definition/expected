- Because pkgs/by-name/no/noEval exists, the attribute `pkgs.noEval` must be defined like

    noEval = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/noEval/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  Notably the second argument must not be empty, which is not the case.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:9 as

    noEval = self.callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/noEval/package.nix { };

- Because pkgs/by-name/on/onlyMove exists, the attribute `pkgs.onlyMove` must be defined like

    onlyMove = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/on/onlyMove/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  Notably the second argument must not be empty, which is not the case.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:7 as

    onlyMove = self.callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/on/onlyMove/package.nix { };

This PR introduces the above problems compared to the base branch, merging is discouraged, but would not break the base branch
