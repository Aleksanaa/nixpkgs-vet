- Because pkgs/by-name/fo/foo exists, the attribute `pkgs.foo` must be defined like

    foo = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/fo/foo/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  This is however not the case: A different `callPackage` is used.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:5 as

    foo = self.alt.callPackage ({ }: self.someDrv) { };
This PR introduces the above problems, merging would break the base branch
