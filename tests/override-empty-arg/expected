- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `pkgs.nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  Notably the second argument must not be empty, which is not the case.
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:2 as

    nonDerivation = self.callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { };
This PR introduces the above problems compared to the base branch, merging is discouraged, but would not break the base branch
