- Because pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation exists, the attribute `pkgs.nonDerivation` must be defined like

    nonDerivation = callPackage ./pkgs/by-name/no/nonDerivation/package.nix { /* ... */ };

  This is however not the case: The first callPackage argument is not right:
  It is defined in all-packages.nix:2 as

    nonDerivation = self.callPackage ({ someDrv }: someDrv) { };
This PR introduces the above problems, merging would break the base branch
