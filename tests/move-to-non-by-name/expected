- Attribute `pkgs.foo1 was previously defined in pkgs/by-name/fo/foo1/package.nix, but is now manually defined as `callPackage ... { /* ... */ }` in /home/tweagysil/src/nixpkgs/by-name-improv/pkgs/test/nixpkgs-check-by-name/tests/move-to-non-by-name/all-packages.nix.
  Please move the package back and remove the manual `callPackage`.

- Attribute `pkgs.foo2 was previously defined in pkgs/by-name/fo/foo2/package.nix, but is now manually defined as `callPackage ./without-config.nix { /* ... */ }` in /home/tweagysil/src/nixpkgs/by-name-improv/pkgs/test/nixpkgs-check-by-name/tests/move-to-non-by-name/all-packages.nix.
  Please move the package back and remove the manual `callPackage`.

- Attribute `pkgs.foo3` was previously defined in pkgs/by-name/fo/foo3/package.nix, but is now manually defined as `callPackage ... { ... }` in /home/tweagysil/src/nixpkgs/by-name-improv/pkgs/test/nixpkgs-check-by-name/tests/move-to-non-by-name/all-packages.nix.
  While the manual `callPackage` is still needed, it's not necessary to move the package files.

- Attribute `pkgs.foo4` was previously defined in pkgs/by-name/fo/foo4/package.nix, but is now manually defined as `callPackage ./with-config.nix { ... }` in /home/tweagysil/src/nixpkgs/by-name-improv/pkgs/test/nixpkgs-check-by-name/tests/move-to-non-by-name/all-packages.nix.
  While the manual `callPackage` is still needed, it's not necessary to move the package files.
